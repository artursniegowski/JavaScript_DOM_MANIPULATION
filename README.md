# JavaScript_DOM_MANIPULATION
This is a repository of projects related to manipulation of the Document Object Model with the help of JavaScript (including jQuery). With these projects, you can learn how to use JS to alter elements and behavior on your website. 

## 01_Dice_Game
This is a game where, each time the website gets refreshed, the dice will get rolled automatically.
The player with the highest number wins! The number rolled is chosen randomly. DOM manipulation with JS.

## 02_Drum_Kit
This is a website where the user can play a sound by pressing the keyboard keys "w," "a," "s," "d," "j," "k," "l," or by clicking on a picture on the website. It is a fun way of creating music by randomly selecting elements. DOM manipulation with JS.

## 03_Simon_Game
This game is based on the popular Simon game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game).
The user has to press any key to start the game, and then it will start showing you the tiles you have to click on, and every time you correctly press the pattern shown, it will move to the next level. Every level will have more complex patterns (always new random patterns) to follow to make it harder for the user to pass. This way, the game will increase in difficulty. At some point, if you choose the wrong tile, it will end the game. The sound effect will help the user identify whether the level was passed or failed and whether a tile was pressed. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
